#README
#This Python program is a simulation that spits out a reciept for an order at "Matthew's Coffee Shop".
#The user is asked to input the number of each item they want to buy.
#The program then calculates the subtotal, applies a 6% tax, and gives a receipt.
# Author: BRITTANY WROTE THIS WHOLE PROGRAM NOT MATTHEW :)

#Program:
#- Inputs: Number of coffees, muffins, scones, and brownies.
#- Prices: Coffee is $5 each, Muffins are $4 each, scones are $3 each, and brownies are $2 each
#- Output: A receipt showing the number of items, price breakdown, tax, and total.

#How to Use:
#1. Run the program.
#2. Enter the number of each item when prompted.
#3. The program will display a receipt with itemized prices, tax, and the final total.

numMuffins = int(input('How many muffins would you like?: '))

numScones = int(input('How many scones would you like?: '))

numBrownies = int(input('How many brownies would you like?: '))





# Calculating subtotal

coffeeTotal = numCoffees * coffeePrice

muffinTotal = numMuffins * muffinPrice

sconeTotal = numScones * sconePrice

brownieTotal = numBrownies * browniePrice

subtotal = coffeeTotal + muffinTotal + sconeTotal + brownieTotal





# Calculating tax code below

tax = subtotal * taxRate


# Calculating total code below

total = subtotal + tax
